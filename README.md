Helper Scripts 

## dockerUninstall.bash
-  uninstalls Docker when the Descktop app is unavailable. 
-  Give Terminal permission to run your script. Don’t copy and paste the content – you need to tell Terminal to make the script file executable using the chmod +x command, for example:
-  `chmod +x ~/Desktop/myFolder/myscript.bash`
